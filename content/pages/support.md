# Ways you can support us
Content creators who don't charge for their services with memberships, direct money donations or premium subscriptions find it somewhat difficult to receive support. We are no exception.

## Share our content
The best support for our work is always to reach and help as much people as we can.

Visit our [Contact + Social page](/pages/contact-social/), make sure to follow and subscribe and share our profiles with your friends.

## Decentralized web
Instead of asking directly for $ donations, we chose to take a different approach. These websites reward their users for engagement, interaction and content creation.
